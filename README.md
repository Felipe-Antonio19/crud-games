"# crud-games" 

This is my first API. It went created all the functions with NodeJs. Using the express and body-parser libreary. To started i used an array as database, but i'm working in it to update to a real database using SQL and sequelize library.
This REST API is intended to be a crud games. Then you will have the function to list, add, delete and edit the entire game database
